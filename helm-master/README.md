## Helm
Helm is a free, cross-platform, polyphonic synthesizer that runs on GNU/Linux, Mac, and Windows as a standalone program and as a LV2/VST/AU/AAX plugin. Release is in beta so there are outstanding bugs. Please send any bugs found to matthewtytel@gmail.com

### Installing:
Go to [tytel.org/helm](http://tytel.org/helm) for builds.

### Building:
If you want to build VST/AAX plugins You'll need their SDKs located in ~/srcs  
For AU on the Mac you'll want to put the CoreAudio SDK in /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Extras/CoreAudio  
Nothing extra is needed for building LV2 plugins

#### GNU/Linux

make
```
The standalone executable is located in standalone/builds/linux/build  
The LV2 plugin is located in builds/linux/LV2
